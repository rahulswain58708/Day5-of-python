# 📘 Day 5 - Python Loops & Mini Project

## ✅ What I Learned

Today, I focused on **loops in Python** — one of the most important concepts for automating tasks and repeating actions.

### 🔁 Loops Covered:
- **`for` loop** – Used for iterating over sequences like lists, strings, ranges, etc.
- **`while` loop** – Runs as long as a condition is `True`.

### 🧠 Loop Concepts Practiced:
- Printing patterns with loops
- Iterating through strings and lists
- Using `break` and `continue` statements
- Nested loops for advanced logic

## 🎮 Mini Project: Number Guessing Game

I built a simple **Number Guessing Game** using Python loops.

### 👇 How It Works:
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player has to guess the number.
- After each guess, the program gives a hint:
  - Too low ❌
  - Too high ❌
  - Correct ✅
- The game uses a `while` loop to keep running until the player guesses correctly.
